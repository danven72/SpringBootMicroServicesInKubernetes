# Step 1: Two simple REST Services
This is the initial step: we have two simple springboot microservices:
- bookService
- authorService

Each service is int its own directory.
### Book Service 
It runs at port 7070 and expose the rest-api GET /books

### Author Service
It runs at port 7071 and expose the rest-api GET /authors
